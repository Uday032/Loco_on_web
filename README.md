We have to use xampp to store data using php. There you have to make two database named Trivia and Digi_login.
In Trivia database you have to make a Table named Login_info with attributes id(INT AUTOINCREMENT) ,first(VARCHAR(30)) ,last(VARCHAR(30)),mobile(VARCHAR(10)),pwd(VARCHAR(255))
and in Digi_login you habe to make a tabel named question_info with attribute id(INT AUTOINCREMENT),question(VARCHAR(255)),
answer(VARCHAR(30)).
